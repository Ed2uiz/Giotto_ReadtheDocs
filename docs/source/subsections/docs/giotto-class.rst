Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Framework of giotto object to store and work with spatial expression
data

Details
~~~~~~~

[**expression**] There are several ways to provide expression
information:

[**expression_feat**] The different features or modalities such as rna,
protein, metabolites, ... that are provided in the expression slot.
