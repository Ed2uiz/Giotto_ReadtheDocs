S4 spatialGridObj Class
-----------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Framework to store spatial grid

Details
~~~~~~~

This is an S4 object that defines a spatial grid. The structure of the
grid is stored as a ``data.table`` within the ``gridDT`` slot and is
defined by start and stop spatial locations along the spatial axes. The
``data.table`` also includes names for each cell of the grid and names
for each of the spatial axis locations that make up the cell. Grids can
be annotated with both spatial and feature information
