``coordDataDT-class``
=====================

Basic class for classes with coordinate information

Description
-----------

coordDataDT is the specific flavor that deals with objects where the
coordinate information is stored within data.table objects and should
work similarly to data.table when interacting with some basic generic
operators for data retreival and setting.
