# `coordDataDT-class`

Basic class for classes with coordinate information


## Description

coordDataDT is the specific flavor that deals with objects where the coordinate
 information is stored within data.table objects and should work similarly to
 data.table when interacting with some basic generic operators for data
 retreival and setting.
