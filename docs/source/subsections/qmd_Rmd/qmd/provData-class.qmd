# `provData-class`

Basic class for classes with provenance information.


## Description

This kind of information is necesssary when generating data that is aggregated
 from multiple original sources of raw information. This could refer to situations
 such as when producing cellxfeature expression matrices from subcellular transcript
 information and polygons that are provided as multiple z layers. Provenance
 is Giotto's method of mapping this aggregated information back to the original
 z layers that were used in its generation.
