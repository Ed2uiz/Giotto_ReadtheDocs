# `rotate_spatial_locations`

Rotate spatial locations


## Description

Rotate given spatlocs by given radians


## Usage

```r
rotate_spatial_locations(
  spatlocs,
  rotateradians = c(xy = 0, zy = 0, xz = 0),
  rcenter = c(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`spatlocs`     |     spatial locations to use
`rotateradians`     |     Named vector of radians for rotation along each of the 3 coordinate axes. If only a single value is provided, it will be treated as xy rotation.
`rcenter`     |     center of rotation given as vector xy(z) coordinates (defaults to coordinate center)


## Details

Radians are provided through `rotateradians` param as a named vector
 with values for `xy` (yaw), `zy` (pitch), `xz` (roll)
